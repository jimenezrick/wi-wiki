  Wi! wiki
============

Ultra-minimalistic wiki written in Bash. Very small, just a single CGI
script.  All the content of the wiki is stored in a Git repository, each
article is saved as a separated text file in Markdown syntax. It is so
simple that it doesn't have any user management (KISS philosophy).


 Features
----------

- Dead-simple
- File-based using a Git repository
- Content optionally generated statically
- Markdown syntax


 Dependencies
--------------

- Bash
- Git
- Markdown-to-HTML converter like: markdown, python-markdown, ...
- Web server with CGI support


 Install
---------

Create a Git repository with read/write permission for the CGI script
and accesible by the web server, then copy all the Wi! wiki files to
that repository. Symlink or copy wi.sh to your CGIs directory.

Look at the top of wi.sh to customize three variables: Markdown program
name, location of the wiki repository and the CGI URL path (the last two
are relative paths to the web server root).

Could be a good idea to create an URL alias in your web server like
this:

	http://host.com/cgi-bin/wi.sh -> http://host.com/wiki


 Usage
-------

Apart from the CGI functionality, you can run the next command to create
a static version of the wiki content:

	wi.sh --generate-static

This is useful for a cron job to replicate statically the content of the
wiki every day.

It's highly recommended to run the CGI as a dedicated user for such
task, as the shell script CGIs are always in danger of exploitation.

If you find unpleasant the idea of a public wiki with no user
management, just put the wiki in some hidden place and show to the
public the static version.

Note: the `Undo' button is just a `git reset HEAD^' on the repository.
